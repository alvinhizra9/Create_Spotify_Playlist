# Create_Spotify_Playlist

A Spotify Playlist Generator of Best Songs of Rolling Stone's Top 200 Rap Album.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a Python application that generates a custom Spotify playlist based on Rolling Stone's Top 200 Rap Album. The application will use the Spotify Web API and the Spotipy library to access the user's Spotify account and create a new playlist. For scrapping, will use Beautyful4Soup.

I am doing this because I love Rap music and want to add the best songs of Rolling Stone's Top 200 Rap Album. I also want to try Spotify API, Spotipy Librabry, and scrap data using Beautiful4Soup. Since these can be corelated, I create this script to help me create playlist easily.

2. Authenticate the user's Spotify account using the Spotipy library.
